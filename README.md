XML Assignment 2

The xml file used for this assignment is the originally downloaded one.

Notes: 
1. One of the customer elements in the orders.xml was missing an email so I set minOccurs to 0 to validate the document. 

2. The assignment instructions said that orderID follows the pattern or### however the xml document has orderId in the pattern or####. I kept it as or### so it may not validate on the original xml file without removing one digit from each order number.
